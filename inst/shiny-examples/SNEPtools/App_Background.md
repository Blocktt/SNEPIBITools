Background
==========

An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was developed for macroinvertebrate
assemblages in low gradient, freshwater streams in the Southeast New
England region, which includes coastal areas in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island (Figure 1). A report detailing the development of the IBI can be
found here . The work was funded by the Southeast New England Coastal
Watershed Restoration Program (SNEP) and was done in partnership with
the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RI DEM),
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (Mass DEP) and the
New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC).

Intended application
--------------------

The SNEP IBI is intended to be applied to samples collected from low
gradient, slow-moving, wadeable, freshwater, non-tidal streams in Rhode
Island and Massachusetts, using MassDEP or SNEP multihabitat sampling
methods. Samples are collected between July 1–September 30, using a net
with 500 μm mesh. Ten kicks, sweeps, and/or jabs are taken over a 100-m
reach and then composited into a single sample. Organisms are collected
from the following habitats (in proportion to their occurrence):
submerged wood, submerged vegetation, undercut banks/overhanging
vegetation, and hard bottom/rocky substrates. Taxa identifications are
done to the lowest practical level in the laboratory. The SNEP IBI was
calibrated with 300-count samples. It can also be applied to 200 or
100-count samples, but 300 are recommended.

If you apply the IBIs to samples that do not meet the criteria listed
above, results should be interpreted with caution.
